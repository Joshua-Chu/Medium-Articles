//instead of naming your variable like this

const var1 = "joshua";

// you could be more specific and help your self out a little bit

const userName = "joshua";


// I often name my functions this way

function func1 (){
    console.log(`${userName} has logged in`);
}

// You could do this to save future confusion

function logIn(){
    console.log(`${userName} has logged in`);
}
